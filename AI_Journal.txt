Week 1: This week, while working on the exercise on Google Colab, there were a few places where I used AI to help me debug some silly mistakes as well as to ask it to give examples for certain concepts as over the years I have forgotten some basics on python, my most recent time coding on this had to have been my freshmen year of college, and then some during some computer sciecne courses in high school. The first 13 exercises went fairly smooth for me didn't need any AI for that. But when I got to exercise 14 ,I had to ask it on what exactly pages_per_day= total_pages / max(days_until_due, 1). This line meant that it was given in the instructions just so I had an understanding of what I needed to print. And the only other place I used AI for exercise 26, it was actually a silly mistake that I could not figure out because I was not looking closley my code was write but my spelling for author were off with my defintion and the print function. Because they were different, I was unable to identify what the issue was so I had to ask and figured it was the writing. Overall ,while using chat GPT for some of these things I did see that it was able to help in terms of giving examples for things like excersise 14 and just being able to explain to you what exactly a certain line of code does.

Week 2: This week, I used very minimal AI to help me complete the INST326 Week 2 Exercises, which focused on conditionals, loops, and list operations. Loops and conditions are skills that I have used in Java in both of my early CS courses in CMSC131 and CMSC132 courses, and they were fairly similar in design in terms of the way that they are used especially in python. In terms of what I used AI for, for excersice 14 I just needed to ask chat gpt to give me a general layout of how to do that excercise without using the max key becasue the max is something I remember using back in high school and thought that I would be able to use it here but I wasn't so I wanted to just get a rough idea of how to do it without it. So it give me several examples, it essentialy told me of the starting point and how to loop through each title. And the other thing I used AI this week was for learning how to use the pop feature and what exactly len does to a certain thing like len(titles) I remember using the fucntion len but was not sure what it exactly it does or how exactly it is used. It was able to give me clear examples and then gave me a question with set titles as a seperate question for me to answer but overall with somewhat use of AI I was able to get a full grasp of this weeks coding assignment and what the neccesary skills were for it.

Week 3: This week we made small, reusable functions to manage a pretend library system that was given to us in the main google colab. This week my AI was use yet again minimal but when I did use it, it was for a good reason and purpose. As a CS major many of the skills of making a function on python is very familiar to me and the concept overall of what a function is and what it does. But this week what I used AI was for print statments to help me test my code, I am not very good at making print statments and never have been in terms of the fact that i know how to write the code but if i was asked to write a basic print statment i would be stumped as to what to put sometimes, so this week just to get a sense of what exactly a certain code would want from me i used Gemini to help me direction myself into writing an effective print statment. i didnt ask it for help on all my code, just a few that were neccesary ofcourse. I also had some silly indentation issues that I could not clear up for example exercise 30 which required more code thne the other ones so i asked CHATGPT to see where my indentation mistake was. Again after using these platforms to help me with this assigment it is istill important to realize that they are very capabale platforms if not more then us, they are still somewhat more able to write coder that is better then ours and give us solutions that may be more effective, and at the moment its helping in python seems to very strong.

Week 4: This week’s exercises on classes and objects were fairly easy. I completed most independently, including Book, Member, Shelf, and UserNote. I only needed help on "Exercise 11: CatalogEntry" to fix the keyword search logic and a few minor indentation errors. The AI helped me correct these quickly. Overall, I was able to understand and apply __init__, instance attributes, and instance methods without much difficulty. Overall again I used a mix of CHATGPT and Gemini and they both gave me very similar answers to my problems so its safe to say they are experienced in the sector of python.

Week 5: This week’s exercises focused on encapsulation and data hiding, including using getters, setters, and property decorators. Most of the material felt manageable, and I was able to complete the majority of the work on my own. I only needed some help with debugging on Exercises 5, 16, and 17, which mostly involved small syntax and logic issues in my class definitions I couldn't find out what the issue was because I was not looking closely so I used CHATGPT to help me a little bit on the issue. The AI helped me quickly identify and fix these errors. Overall, I felt confident with concepts like private and protected attributes, property setters, and basic validation logic. I continued to use both ChatGPT and Gemini for support, and both provided clear, similar explanations and code examples. Again even in week 5, these AI softwares do know a lot about python and if they are given proper instructions and specifics, it is able to be done properly.
