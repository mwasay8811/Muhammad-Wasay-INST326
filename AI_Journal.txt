Week 1: This week, while working on the exercise on Google Colab, there were a few places where I used AI to help me debug some silly mistakes as well as to ask it to give examples for certain concepts as over the years I have forgotten some basics on python, my most recent time coding on this had to have been my freshmen year of college, and then some during some computer sciecne courses in high school. The first 13 exercises went fairly smooth for me didn't need any AI for that. But when I got to exercise 14 ,I had to ask it on what exactly pages_per_day= total_pages / max(days_until_due, 1). This line meant that it was given in the instructions just so I had an understanding of what I needed to print. And the only other place I used AI for exercise 26, it was actually a silly mistake that I could not figure out because I was not looking closley my code was write but my spelling for author were off with my defintion and the print function. Because they were different, I was unable to identify what the issue was so I had to ask and figured it was the writing. Overall ,while using chat GPT for some of these things I did see that it was able to help in terms of giving examples for things like excersise 14 and just being able to explain to you what exactly a certain line of code does.

Week 2: This week, I used very minimal AI to help me complete the INST326 Week 2 Exercises, which focused on conditionals, loops, and list operations. Loops and conditions are skills that I have used in Java in both of my early CS courses in CMSC131 and CMSC132 courses, and they were fairly similar in design in terms of the way that they are used especially in python. In terms of what I used AI for, for excersice 14 I just needed to ask chat gpt to give me a general layout of how to do that excercise without using the max key becasue the max is something I remember using back in high school and thought that I would be able to use it here but I wasn't so I wanted to just get a rough idea of how to do it without it. So it give me several examples, it essentialy told me of the starting point and how to loop through each title. And the other thing I used AI this week was for learning how to use the pop feature and what exactly len does to a certain thing like len(titles) I remember using the fucntion len but was not sure what it exactly it does or how exactly it is used. It was able to give me clear examples and then gave me a question with set titles as a seperate question for me to answer but overall with somewhat use of AI I was able to get a full grasp of this weeks coding assignment and what the neccesary skills were for it.

Week 3: This week we made small, reusable functions to manage a pretend library system that was given to us in the main google colab. This week my AI was use yet again minimal but when I did use it, it was for a good reason and purpose. As a CS major many of the skills of making a function on python is very familiar to me and the concept overall of what a function is and what it does. But this week what I used AI was for print statments to help me test my code, I am not very good at making print statments and never have been in terms of the fact that i know how to write the code but if i was asked to write a basic print statment i would be stumped as to what to put sometimes, so this week just to get a sense of what exactly a certain code would want from me i used Gemini to help me direction myself into writing an effective print statment. i didnt ask it for help on all my code, just a few that were neccesary ofcourse. I also had some silly indentation issues that I could not clear up for example exercise 30 which required more code thne the other ones so i asked CHATGPT to see where my indentation mistake was. Again after using these platforms to help me with this assigment it is istill important to realize that they are very capabale platforms if not more then us, they are still somewhat more able to write coder that is better then ours and give us solutions that may be more effective, and at the moment its helping in python seems to very strong.

Week 4: This week’s exercises on classes and objects were fairly easy. I completed most independently, including Book, Member, Shelf, and UserNote. I only needed help on "Exercise 11: CatalogEntry" to fix the keyword search logic and a few minor indentation errors. The AI helped me correct these quickly. Overall, I was able to understand and apply __init__, instance attributes, and instance methods without much difficulty. Overall again I used a mix of CHATGPT and Gemini and they both gave me very similar answers to my problems so its safe to say they are experienced in the sector of python.

Week 5: This week’s exercises focused on encapsulation and data hiding, including using getters, setters, and property decorators. Most of the material felt manageable, and I was able to complete the majority of the work on my own. I only needed some help with debugging on Exercises 5, 16, and 17, which mostly involved small syntax and logic issues in my class definitions I couldn't find out what the issue was because I was not looking closely so I used CHATGPT to help me a little bit on the issue. The AI helped me quickly identify and fix these errors. Overall, I felt confident with concepts like private and protected attributes, property setters, and basic validation logic. I continued to use both ChatGPT and Gemini for support, and both provided clear, similar explanations and code examples. Again even in week 5, these AI softwares do know a lot about python and if they are given proper instructions and specifics, it is able to be done properly.

Week 6: The exercises of this week were based on the approaches and class design, such as instance methods, class methods, and static methods. The jobs involved assembly of parts of a Library Management Project. I completed the majority of the exercises by myself, whereas I had to be assisted a bit at the beginning with Exercises 10 and 11. Some of my difficulty was in how to define how the Library class and its functions like register_member and check out were to be put together and how the appropriate way to use the static methods to filter in the search class could be implemented properly. The ChatGPT provided me with the first information on how to implement these techniques, allowing me to learn how the classmethod and staticmethod decorators should be used. Once I had a good example then I could proceed alone and finish the remaining part of the project without any hitch. On the whole, I am more confident about the ability to create well-structured classes and understand the various effects of instance, class and static methods used in object-oriented programming. Overall, even getting deeper into python coding, CHATGPT is still fairly updated and is keeping up to standard with helping in the weekly excersises.

Week 7: The exercises of this week focused on error handling and testing within the Library Management Project. The main objectives were to practice using try, except, else, and finally blocks, raising custom exceptions, and writing basic unit tests using the unittest module. I was able to complete most of the exercises independently, though I initially needed some guidance in setting up the proper structure for the unit tests in Exercise 12 and implementing the correct exit codes in Exercise 9. My main difficulty was ensuring that each exception type returned the correct code and that invalid ISBN values raised the right errors during testing. ChatGPT helped me understand how to structure the main(argv) function with the proper use of sys.exit() and how to organize unit tests with clear test cases for valid and invalid ISBN inputs. Once I had an example to follow, I was able to adapt it to my own project and confidently verify my code through tests. Overall, I’ve gained a much better understanding of how exception handling contributes to writing more reliable and professional Python programs which I can use in my future of CS and software engineering future, and how testing ensures that my functions behave as expected. This week strengthened both my debugging skills and my confidence in structuring code that can properly handle unexpected situations.

Week 8: This week’s exercises focused on inheritance and polymorphism in the Library Management Project. I practiced creating subclasses, overriding methods, using super(), and deciding when to apply composition instead of inheritance. I created Student and Staff classes that inherited from Member, each overriding the max_concurrent_loans() method to reflect different borrowing limits, and I implemented a simple Notifier class to demonstrate composition by having the LoanDesk use it to send messages during checkouts. The two exercises I needed help on were Exercise 5, where I learned how to properly override methods and use super() effectively, and Exercise 9, which helped me understand when composition is more appropriate than inheritance. ChatGPT guided me in distinguishing between “is-a” and “has-a” relationships, which made it easier to design the LoanDesk correctly. I also wrote unit tests to confirm that overriding worked for PrintedBook and ReferenceBook, checking that their loan_period_days() and str() outputs matched expectations. Overall, I improved my understanding of how inheritance structures and polymorphism create more reusable code, and I feel more confident applying these object-oriented design principles in future projects. This is the second or third time that I had to give CHATGPT multiple responses to help me get what I wanted in the pursuit of the work I had to train it several times to give me help on the excerises for question 5 and 9.

Week 9: This week’s exercises focused on abstract classes and interface-like design in the Library Management Project. I learned how to use abstract base classes with abstract methods and properties to enforce consistent structure among subclasses. I implemented a daily late fee system by defining an abstract method in the main item class and giving each subclass—PrintedBook, EBook, and AudioBook—its own rate, which helped me see how abstraction supports flexible yet uniform behavior. I also created a download feature by having EBook follow a Downloadable interface and wrote a function that accepted any object meeting that interface, reinforcing the concept of duck typing. The last exercise involved designing a checkout function that worked for any registered item type, showing how virtual subclass registration extends polymorphism. I needed help on Exercise 7 and Exercise 10, where I initially struggled to connect the Downloadable interface and to balance abstract and concrete methods within the same class. ChatGPT guided me in understanding when to use abstraction versus implementation, and after a few exchanges, I was able to structure everything correctly. Overall, I strengthened my grasp of how abstract classes and interfaces improve code organization and reusability. I am understanding more that since the projects have been getting a bit more tough in the sense that there is more information that we need to give it, you need to ask it several times before getting a defintive answer in terms of the code that we need. Most time I have to let chatgpt know several times that there are some methods and functions that we are not allowed to use because they are not in the scope of week 1-9 but it still struggles a bit, almost rearing towards the end of the semester now that we look at it, there is a more tuff time getting a accurate response the first time. UPDATE: I also used AI to help me with most of Excercise 20 even after the lecture I was still farily confused on that subject question and hoping to make sure I clear it up more in the next section, although i got a better understanding after I put it in AI I still want to make sure i had the full scope of what I was doing.

Week 10: This week focused on refining class design using Python’s data model, properties, and special methods. I learned how @property helps enforce validation while still keeping attributes simple to use—for example, making sure Book.title is never empty and that copies stays within valid limits. I also practiced implementing special methods like __iter__, __contains__, and __repr__ so classes like Catalog behave more like built-in container types. Exercise 13 helped me confirm that Catalog.__iter__ returns books in sorted order, and Exercise 20 had me write small unittest tests for title validation, copy validation, sorted iteration, and __contains__ for both ISBNs and Book objects. Exercise 18 let me practice clean, aligned string formatting by printing a simple catalog table. I used AI to clarify a few design questions, mainly around structuring property setters and deciding when special methods were appropriate. I had to remind it of the Week-10 scope at times, but after a few tries it gave me the correct approach. Overall, this week improved my understanding of how Python’s data model supports clean, organized, and intuitive class behavior. This is the first week I had to use two AI platforms becasue based off my own knowledge I felt as if CHATGPT was not giving me the most accurate answer, so I had to have a few chats open and give me the same response, but I was receiving off answers so I had to do some myself and train CHATGPT with very specific responses to tell it what I needed it to do.
